Hi! I feel like I've been putting off this moment for far too long. For about 7 or 8 years now I've told myself that I should be blogging, but then instead of starting, I put it off. And off. And now it's just gotten awkward... Lets not mention it okay?


## So who the hell am I?

- I'm an Aussie that loves to travel (don't we all?), and have lived in Melbourne, Sydney and Hong Kong. I'm about to move to London and am super excited about the new opportunities & experiences ahead
- I'm a startup co-founder, and have spent the last 3 years growing a fintech company
- I love building and making things, both physical and digital, and aquiring new skills to try different techniques 
- I'm a Psychology nerd, I have studies Psych all through high school and University and love that I get to use the different things I've learnt about human behaviour every day
- I started my career as a software developer and have been lucky enough to work doing some amazingly different things - from development to graphic design, front end development, online marketing, to user experience design and product management


Enjoy the ride! And thanks for reading.
