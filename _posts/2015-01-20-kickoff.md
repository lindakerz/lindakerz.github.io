Hi! I feel like I've been putting off this moment for far too long. For about 7 or 8 years now I've told myself that I should be blogging, but then instead of starting, I put it off. And off. And now it's just gotten awkward... Lets not mention it okay?


**So who the hell am I?**

- I'm an Aussie that loves to travel (don't we all?), and have lived in Melbourne, Sydney and Hong Kong. I'm about to move to London and am super excited about the new opportunities & experiences ahead

- I'm a startup co-founder, and 3 years into growing a fintech company in Hong Kong

- I love building and making things, both physical and digital, and aquiring new skills to try different techniques

- I'm a Phychology nerd, I have studies Psych all through high school and University and am thrilled that it has become useful in my everyday life

- I started my career as a software developer and have been lucky enough to work doing some amazingly different things - from development to graphic design, front end development, to User Experience Design and Product Management
- I'm a total chocoholic
- I'm a listwritter: tasks to do, restaraunts to try, movies to see
- My phone is an Android not Apple - who would have thought for a creative person?! Although I do love my Mac Air, so I guess it's more of a case of liking the right tool for the job and not being a brand devotee

At the moment, I'm thinking this blog will mostly be my observations on UX & Product Management, but who knows what the future will hold!
