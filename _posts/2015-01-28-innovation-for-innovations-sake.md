There's something that I know I have been guilty of in the past, and something I know that all designers & product managers struggle with at times, and that is the idea of innovating "because we want things to be better" and we feel like a big, drastic innovation of the existing experience is the only way to go about making a significant change.

Whilst big, drastic [10x improvements](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/12/video-10x-not-10-product-management-by-orders-of-magnitude-by-ken-norton/) have their place (and I believe they definitely have their place!) the smaller, incremental improvements are places we can really look at improving every day efficiencies. As product managers, we can get caught up in wanting to make things bigger and better. But we always need to be asking: Is this change something our customers really want? Is this change going to bring us greater business efficiency? Is it **worth** the whole team spending a month on this particular change vs something else on our roadmap?

Often we can make big improvements with small changes. For example, we may look at the analytics of a web service and notice that people are leaving the signup page. Maybe we need to rebuild the whole signup experience! We **need** this new service that promises to give everyone that signs up a neck massage, that will improve the signup rates! The whole page should be an immersive experience in VR, but also work on my old flip phone... Okay so I'm going overboard but you get the message. But when we look deeper at the analytics, we notice that users are falling off when we ask for their phone number. Maybe we should ask ourselves why - or better yet, ask **them** why. Do we really need their number? Could we reassure them we're not going to abuse their trust with some extra microcopy around that user interaction? By making a small change, we can improve the user signup rate which has a real business benefit. Definitely not a "sexy" change, not something you would put up on dribbble, or show off to the whole company with a fancy powerpoint presentation to rapturous applause, but still, a solid solid improvement.

Big changes can be monumental. When planned and thought out, they can change the way your business works. But when you're looking at innovating for innovation's sake, you've got to really ask yourself, are you innovating to move forward, or are you just moving laterally?
