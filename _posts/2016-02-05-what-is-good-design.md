title: What is good design
---


We design many products and experiences throughout our careers, as well as judge the validity of the designs of others. Every product and service we use throughout the day has been designed, consiously or not. But what makes one product better designed than another? As far as I'm concerned, good design can be boiled down into three main points.

## Valuable 
You're solving a real problem for real people. This means you've validated the problem actually exists, and that the solution will be valuable for those people affected by this problem.

## Easy to Use
Those people who have the problem find your solution easy to use. What does that even mean? [I like this definition](http://www.wqusability.com/articles/more-than-ease-of-use.html), it means your solution is effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant and easy to learn.

## Well Crafted
The entire experience feels obvious - when you look at it in retrospect you wouldn't have designed it any other way. It has been built with thought and care, and is free from errors or inconsistencies.
